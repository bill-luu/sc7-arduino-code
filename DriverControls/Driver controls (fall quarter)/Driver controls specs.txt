State:

-Raw acceleration : int
	The raw value of the acceleration pedal.             
-Safe acceleration limit : int
	The value of a safe acceleration. Not clear on how this is calculated?????    
-Brake engaged? : bool
	True if the brake pedal is depressed, false otherwise.
-Desired motor acceleration : float
	Acceleration to be given to motor controller. Not clear on how this is
	calculated????

-Key run? : bool
	Not sure what this means???????
-In drive? : bool
	In drive gear?
-In reverse? : bool
	In reverse gear?
-In regen? : bool
	In regen mode?

[Note: We can combine these ^ into one variable controlled by constants: e.g. gear = G_DRIVE or gear = G_REV. - AM 10/31/14]

-Left turn signal? : bool
	Left turn on?
-Right turn signal? : bool
	Right turn on?
-Headlights? : bool
	Headlights on?
-Horn? : bool
	Horn on?
-Brakes : bool
	Whether the brake pedal is engaged. Brake lights should turn on.

-BMS state : {Error, Idle, EnablePack, Measure, Precharge, Run}
	BMS mode.

[-Using hardware switches : bool    
	Not sure what this means???????? DO NOT NEED]
[Note: Use hardware switches was a hack that Chandel made last year while he was making the touch-screen steering system for the car. We'll be designing better in SC7, so we do not need to worry about this; hardware switches will be used at ALL times for now. -AM 10/31/14]

-Car velocity : float
	Current velocity of the car.
-Bus voltage : float
	Voltage of the bus.					
-Bus current : float
	Current of the bus.					

RX/TX:

TX
-Drive command : driver controls -> motor controller
	Send the desired motor velocity (% of max) and desired
	current (% of max) to the motor controller.
-Power command (probably unused) : driver controls -> motor controller
	Send the percentage of current to draw
	from the bus to the motor controller.
-Reset command (probably unused) : driver controls -> motor controller
	Reset the motor controller.
	[ When does this need to be sent? -AM 10/31/14] ##########
-Switch position : driver controls -> BMS
	Send start or run commands to the BMS. Hardware side of this
	still needs to be fleshed out.
-Display data : driver controls -> Steering wheel
	Send car state info to the LCD display. Waiting for hardware information.
RX
-BMS state : BMS -> driver controls
	Precharge state of BMS.
-Motor velocity : motor controller -> driver controls
	Current speed of the motor.
-Bus state : Motor Controller -> driver controls
	Bus voltage and current 
-User commands : Steering wheel -> driver controls
	Many status updates: key run?, in drive?, in reverse?,
	in regen?, left turn signal?, right turn signal?, 
	headlights?, horn?
