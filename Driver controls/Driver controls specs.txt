Driver controls state variables:

-Raw acceleration : int             
-Safe acceleration limit : int          
-Brake engaged? : bool
-Desired motor acceleration : float

-Ignition on? : bool
-In drive? : bool
-In reverse? : bool
-In regen? : bool

-Left turn signal? : bool
-Right turn signal? : bool
-Headlights? : bool
-Horn? : bool

-BMS state : {Error, Idle, EnablePack, Measure, Precharge, Run}

-Using hardware switches : bool????
-Car velocity : float
-Bus voltage : float					
-Bus current : float					

Driver controls RX/TX:

TX
-Drive command: sends the desired motor velocity (% of max) and desired
current (% of max) to the motor controller.
-Power command (probably unused): sends the percentage of current to draw
from the bus to the motor controller.
-Reset command (probably unused): resets the motor controller.
-Switch position: send start or run commands to the BMS. Hardware side of this
still needs to be fleshed out.
-Display data: sends car state info to the LCD display.
