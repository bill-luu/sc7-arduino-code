State:

-Raw acceleration : int
	The raw value of the acceleration pedal.             
-Safe acceleration limit : int
	The value of a safe acceleration. Not clear on how this is calculated?????    
-Brake engaged? : bool
	True if the brake pedal is depressed, false otherwise.
-Desired motor acceleration : float
	Acceleration to be given to motor controller. Not clear on how this is
	calculated????

-Key run? : bool
	Not sure what this means???????
-In drive? : bool
	In drive gear?
-In reverse? : bool
	In reverse gear?
-In regen? : bool
	In regen mode?

-Left turn signal? : bool
	Left turn on?
-Right turn signal? : bool
	Right turn on?
-Headlights? : bool
	Headlights on?
-Horn? : bool
	Horn on?
What about brake lights?????

-BMS state : {Error, Idle, EnablePack, Measure, Precharge, Run}
	BMS mode.

-Using hardware switches : bool    
	Not sure what this means????????
-Car velocity : float
	Current velocity of the car.
-Bus voltage : float
	Voltage of the bus.					
-Bus current : float
	Current of the bus.					

RX/TX:

TX
-Drive command : driver controls -> motor controller
	Send the desired motor velocity (% of max) and desired
	current (% of max) to the motor controller.
-Power command (probably unused) : driver controls -> motor controller
	Send the percentage of current to draw
	from the bus to the motor controller.
-Reset command (probably unused) : driver controls -> motor controller
	Reset the motor controller.
-Switch position : driver controls -> BMS
	Send start or run commands to the BMS. Hardware side of this
	still needs to be fleshed out.
-Display data : driver controls -> LCD dipsay
	Send car state info to the LCD display.
RX
-BMS state : BMS -> driver controls
	Precharge state of BMS.
-Motor velocity : motor controller -> driver controls
	Current speed of the motor.
-Bus state : ?? -> driver controls
	Bus voltage and current
-User commands : ?? -> driver controls
	Many status updates: key run?, in drive?, in reverse?,
	in regen?, left turn signal?, right turn signal?, 
	headlights?, horn?
